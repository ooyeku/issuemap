            Parent epic for comprehensive storage management improvements to prevent disk space issues.

            ## Problem Statement
            Issuemap currently lacks storage management capabilities, leading to potential disk space exhaustion over time. Active teams can accumulate gigabytes of data with no cleanup or optimization mechanisms.

            ## Current Issues
            - No storage limits or quotas
            - No cleanup mechanisms
            - Attachments stored uncompressed
            - Duplicate files stored multiple times
            - No visibility into storage usage
            - Old data persists forever

            ## Solution Overview
            Implement comprehensive storage management through:
            1. Monitoring and quotas (ISSUEMAP-093)
            2. Automatic cleanup (ISSUEMAP-094)
            3. Manual cleanup tools (ISSUEMAP-097)
            4. Storage monitoring (ISSUEMAP-098)
            5. Archive functionality (ISSUEMAP-099)
            6. File deduplication (ISSUEMAP-096)
            7. Attachment compression (ISSUEMAP-100)
            8. Cloud storage option (ISSUEMAP-095)

            ## Expected Benefits
            - Prevent disk space exhaustion
            - Reduce storage by 50-70%
            - Better performance
            - Scalability for large teams
            - Cost savings (cloud storage)

            ## Implementation Phases
            Phase 1 (v0.6.0): Critical features
            - Storage monitoring (ISSUEMAP-098)
            - Cleanup commands (ISSUEMAP-097)
            - Quotas and limits (ISSUEMAP-093)
            - Automatic cleanup (ISSUEMAP-094)

            Phase 2 (v0.7.0): Optimizations
            - Archive functionality (ISSUEMAP-099)
            - File deduplication (ISSUEMAP-096)
            - Compression (ISSUEMAP-100)
            - Cloud storage (ISSUEMAP-095)

            ## Success Metrics
            - Storage growth rate reduced by 70%
            - Average project size under 500MB
            - Zero disk space incidents
            - Cleanup automation working
