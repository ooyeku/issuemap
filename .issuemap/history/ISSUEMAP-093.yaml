            Add configurable storage limits and monitoring capabilities to prevent disk space issues.

            ## Problem
            Currently, issuemap has no built-in storage limits or monitoring, which can lead to excessive disk usage over time. Teams using attachments heavily could accumulate gigabytes of data without warning.

            ## Requirements
            - Add StorageConfig struct with configurable limits (MaxProjectSize, MaxAttachmentAge, etc.)
            - Implement real-time storage monitoring
            - Add warnings when approaching storage limits
            - Prevent uploads that would exceed quotas
            - Add configuration options in config file

            ## Technical Details
            - Track total .issuemap directory size
            - Monitor attachment storage separately
            - Provide API endpoints for storage metrics
            - Include storage info in 'issuemap info' command

            ## Acceptance Criteria
            - [ ] Storage limits can be configured
            - [ ] Users are warned before hitting limits
            - [ ] Storage usage is visible in CLI and web UI
            - [ ] Uploads are blocked when quota exceeded
