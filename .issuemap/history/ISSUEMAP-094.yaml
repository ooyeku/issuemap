            Implement automatic cleanup processes to manage storage growth over time.

            ## Problem
            Data accumulates indefinitely without any automatic cleanup, leading to storage bloat. Closed issues, old attachments, and historical data persist forever.

            ## Requirements
            - Background cleanup process that runs periodically
            - Configurable retention policies for different data types
            - Safe deletion with backup/archive options
            - Cleanup of orphaned attachments
            - Removal of old time entries and history

            ## Implementation
            - Scheduled cleanup tasks (daily/weekly/monthly)
            - Age-based retention policies
            - Size-based triggers for cleanup
            - Dry-run mode for safety
            - Cleanup logs and reports

            ## Acceptance Criteria
            - [ ] Automatic cleanup can be enabled/disabled
            - [ ] Retention policies are configurable
            - [ ] Cleanup runs safely without data loss
            - [ ] Orphaned files are detected and removed
            - [ ] Cleanup activity is logged
