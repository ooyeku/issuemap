            Implement content-based deduplication to avoid storing duplicate files multiple times.

            ## Problem
            The same file uploaded to multiple issues is stored separately each time, wasting disk space. Common files like logos, templates, or documentation get duplicated unnecessarily.

            ## Requirements
            - Hash-based content identification (SHA-256)
            - Reference counting for shared files
            - Automatic deduplication on upload
            - Safe deletion only when last reference removed
            - Migration tool for existing duplicates

            ## Technical Approach
            - Calculate file hash before storage
            - Check if hash already exists
            - Store files by hash, not by name
            - Maintain reference mapping (issue -> hash)
            - Handle hash collisions safely

            ## Benefits
            - Significant space savings (30-50% typical)
            - Faster uploads for duplicate files
            - Reduced backup sizes
            - Better cache utilization

            ## Acceptance Criteria
            - [ ] Duplicate files detected on upload
            - [ ] Storage uses single copy per unique file
            - [ ] Reference counting prevents data loss
            - [ ] Existing duplicates can be deduplicated
            - [ ] Performance impact is minimal
