title: Add automatic cleanup mechanisms for old data
description: |-
    Implement automatic cleanup processes to manage storage growth over time.

    ## Problem
    Data accumulates indefinitely without any automatic cleanup, leading to storage bloat. Closed issues, old attachments, and historical data persist forever.

    ## Requirements
    - Background cleanup process that runs periodically
    - Configurable retention policies for different data types
    - Safe deletion with backup/archive options
    - Cleanup of orphaned attachments
    - Removal of old time entries and history

    ## Implementation
    - Scheduled cleanup tasks (daily/weekly/monthly)
    - Age-based retention policies
    - Size-based triggers for cleanup
    - Dry-run mode for safety
    - Cleanup logs and reports

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] Automatic cleanup can be enabled/disabled
    - [ ] Retention policies are configurable
    - [ ] Cleanup runs safely without data loss
    - [ ] Orphaned files are detected and removed
    - [ ] Cleanup activity is logged
