title: Add storage status monitoring command
description: |-
    Implement a command to monitor and report storage usage statistics.

    ## Problem
    No visibility into current storage usage makes it impossible to proactively manage disk space.

    ## Required Command
    issuemap storage --status

    ## Output Information
    - Total .issuemap directory size
    - Breakdown by data type:
      - Issues: count and size
      - Attachments: count and size
      - History: count and size
      - Time entries: count and size
    - Largest files/attachments
    - Growth rate (if historical data available)
    - Available disk space
    - Warnings if approaching limits

    ## Additional Options
    - issuemap storage --json (machine-readable output)
    - issuemap storage --verbose (detailed breakdown)
    - issuemap storage --largest 10 (show largest files)
    - issuemap storage --by-issue (group by issue)
    - issuemap storage --growth (show growth trends)

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] Command shows current usage
    - [ ] Breakdown by category provided
    - [ ] Large files identified
    - [ ] JSON output supported
    - [ ] Performance is acceptable (<1s)
