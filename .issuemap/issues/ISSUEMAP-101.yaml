title: 'Epic: Storage Management and Optimization'
description: |-
    Parent epic for comprehensive storage management improvements to prevent disk space issues.

    ## Problem Statement
    Issuemap currently lacks storage management capabilities, leading to potential disk space exhaustion over time. Active teams can accumulate gigabytes of data with no cleanup or optimization mechanisms.

    ## Current Issues
    - No storage limits or quotas
    - No cleanup mechanisms
    - Attachments stored uncompressed
    - Duplicate files stored multiple times
    - No visibility into storage usage
    - Old data persists forever

    ## Solution Overview
    Implement comprehensive storage management through:
    1. Monitoring and quotas (ISSUEMAP-093)
    2. Automatic cleanup (ISSUEMAP-094)
    3. Manual cleanup tools (ISSUEMAP-097)
    4. Storage monitoring (ISSUEMAP-098)
    5. Archive functionality (ISSUEMAP-099)
    6. File deduplication (ISSUEMAP-096)
    7. Attachment compression (ISSUEMAP-100)
    8. Cloud storage option (ISSUEMAP-095)

    ## Expected Benefits
    - Prevent disk space exhaustion
    - Reduce storage by 50-70%
    - Better performance
    - Scalability for large teams
    - Cost savings (cloud storage)

    ## Implementation Phases
    Phase 1 (v0.6.0): Critical features
    - Storage monitoring (ISSUEMAP-098)
    - Cleanup commands (ISSUEMAP-097)
    - Quotas and limits (ISSUEMAP-093)
    - Automatic cleanup (ISSUEMAP-094)

    Phase 2 (v0.7.0): Optimizations
    - Archive functionality (ISSUEMAP-099)
    - File deduplication (ISSUEMAP-096)
    - Compression (ISSUEMAP-100)
    - Cloud storage (ISSUEMAP-095)

    ## Success Metrics
    - Storage growth rate reduced by 70%
    - Average project size under 500MB
    - Zero disk space incidents
    - Cleanup automation working
