title: Implement storage quotas and monitoring
description: |-
    Add configurable storage limits and monitoring capabilities to prevent disk space issues.

    ## Problem
    Currently, issuemap has no built-in storage limits or monitoring, which can lead to excessive disk usage over time. Teams using attachments heavily could accumulate gigabytes of data without warning.

    ## Requirements
    - Add StorageConfig struct with configurable limits (MaxProjectSize, MaxAttachmentAge, etc.)
    - Implement real-time storage monitoring
    - Add warnings when approaching storage limits
    - Prevent uploads that would exceed quotas
    - Add configuration options in config file

    ## Technical Details
    - Track total .issuemap directory size
    - Monitor attachment storage separately
    - Provide API endpoints for storage metrics
    - Include storage info in 'issuemap info' command

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] Storage limits can be configured
    - [ ] Users are warned before hitting limits
    - [ ] Storage usage is visible in CLI and web UI
    - [ ] Uploads are blocked when quota exceeded
