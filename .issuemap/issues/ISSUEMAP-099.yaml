title: Implement archive functionality for old issues
description: |-
    Add capability to archive old closed issues to reduce active storage usage.

    ## Problem
    Closed issues remain in active storage forever, even when they're no longer relevant. This contributes to storage bloat and performance degradation.

    ## Requirements
    - Archive closed issues older than configurable threshold
    - Compressed archive format (tar.gz or zip)
    - Searchable archive index
    - Restore capability for archived issues
    - Automatic archival option

    ## Archive Command
    issuemap archive --closed --older-than 6m
    issuemap archive --issue ISSUE-001
    issuemap archive --restore ISSUE-001
    issuemap archive --list
    issuemap archive --search <query>

    ## Archive Structure
    .issuemap/
    └── archives/
        ├── 2025-01-archive.tar.gz
        ├── 2025-02-archive.tar.gz
        └── index.json

    ## Features
    - Compress archived data (70-80% reduction)
    - Maintain searchable index
    - Restore individual issues
    - Bulk restore capability
    - Archive integrity verification

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] Issues can be archived/restored
    - [ ] Archives are compressed
    - [ ] Archive index is searchable
    - [ ] Restore works correctly
    - [ ] Automatic archival configurable
