title: Implement external storage integration (S3, cloud storage)
description: |-
    Add support for storing attachments in external cloud storage services instead of local disk.

    ## Problem
    Large binary files stored locally cause repository bloat and consume disk space. For teams with heavy attachment usage, this becomes unsustainable.

    ## Requirements
    - Support for multiple storage backends (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
    - Configurable storage provider selection
    - Local caching for performance
    - Migration tools for existing attachments
    - Fallback to local storage if cloud unavailable

    ## Storage Providers
    - AWS S3
    - Azure Blob Storage
    - Google Cloud Storage
    - MinIO (self-hosted S3-compatible)
    - Local filesystem (default)

    ## Implementation
    - Abstract storage interface
    - Provider-specific implementations
    - Credential management
    - URL generation for direct access
    - Cost optimization (lifecycle policies)

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] Multiple storage backends supported
    - [ ] Seamless migration from local to cloud
    - [ ] Performance maintained with caching
    - [ ] Secure credential handling
    - [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
