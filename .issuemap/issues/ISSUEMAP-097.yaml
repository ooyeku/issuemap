title: Implement admin cleanup commands
description: |-
    Add CLI commands for manual storage maintenance and cleanup operations.

    ## Problem
    No manual cleanup tools exist for administrators to manage storage when needed. Teams need ability to clean up storage on-demand.

    ## Required Commands
    - issuemap cleanup --older-than <duration>
    - issuemap cleanup --closed --days 180
    - issuemap cleanup --orphaned-attachments
    - issuemap cleanup --time-entries --before <date>
    - issuemap cleanup --dry-run (preview changes)

    ## Features
    - Age-based filtering
    - Status-based filtering
    - Size-based targeting
    - Dry-run mode for safety
    - Confirmation prompts
    - Detailed cleanup reports
    - Undo/restore capability

    ## Safety Measures
    - Always require confirmation
    - Create backup before deletion
    - Log all cleanup operations
    - Provide restore command
    - Validate permissions

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] All cleanup commands implemented
    - [ ] Dry-run mode works correctly
    - [ ] Confirmation required for destructive ops
    - [ ] Cleanup activity is logged
    - [ ] Restore functionality available
